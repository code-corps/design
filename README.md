# Code Corps Elixir API

[![Slack Status](http://slack.codecorps.org/badge.svg)](http://slack.codecorps.org)

This is the design repository for [codecorps.org](https://www.codecorps.org).

Code Corps is an open source platform for building and funding public software with massive social impact.

Our goals:

- **Connect people** - Match developers and designers, project managers and marketers – any and every talent – to ambitious projects that need their help.
- **Provide support** - Educate and train, develop and encourage people who build public software. Help projects be successful and people to do their best work.
- **Fund projects** - Crowdfund ongoing work and keep funders engaged in projects and connected to the teams they're supporting.
- **Develop new tools** - Help people collaborate on, organize, and even distribute their work. Listen closely to hear what needs built, and then build it.

## Things we care about

Our values for this project reflect the Code Corps values as a whole, though with some minor differences.

We care about:

- Each other :raised_hands:
- Social impact :earth_africa:
- Good documentation :memo:
- Testing :microscope:
- Welcoming and teaching new contributors :wave:
- Writing small, clear, and achievable issues :dart:

We also track quantifiable metrics like inline documentation coverage, testing coverage, and so on. You can see some of these metrics in the icons at the top of this page.
